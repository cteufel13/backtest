# backtest


next steps:
    - find some things to put in the side graph on the right:
    Ideas:
        - maybe predicitions?
        - volume that you are trading
        - make graph scrollable to add more stuff
        - maybe reward on trade (no graphs but just numbers)

    general set maximum amount of stuff to prevent from shitty visualization

    TODO on backend:
        - find way to track when stop losses trigger, then experiment with first strategies to maybe implement stuff

        - add all the other fancy stuff, like example volume,
